# Hangman Game with Circular Linked List

This project implements a **Hangman Game** in C++ using a **circular linked list** as the main data structure. It was developed as part of an assignment for the **Data Structures** course in college. In this project, i had the oportunity to learn about **pointers and memory management**, while also practiging my programing logic skills.

The circular linked list is basicaly a common linked list, but its last node has a pointer to the first one.

## Features
- Random word selection from a `.txt` file.
- Interactive terminal-based gameplay.
- Visual representation of the hangman based on the number of incorrect guesses.
- Efficient manipulation of letters and guessed characters using a circular linked list.

## Project Structure
- **`ListaCircular.h`**: Contains the implementation of the circular linked list and related functions.
- **`main.cpp`**: Implements the game logic.
